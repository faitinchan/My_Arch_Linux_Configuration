# My Arch Linux Configuration
The following are the configurations I use to customize my Arch Linux system on Window Surface Book. This is the second version, because the first version was tragically wiped out with the whole operating system due to my mishandling of allocating the free space from one partition to another. Interesting enough, it ended up helping me to understand the system better to make a more consistent theme throughout all of the configurations.
